# flask-boiler-plate

### Flask boiler plate for a minimal "Hello World" application hosted on [Glitch](www.glitch.com)

- `server.py` contains the main code.
- `requirements.txt` contains a list of Python packages you import and use (in this case, it is only Flask).
- `gltich.json` contains the configuration file necessary for Glitch. Change the file names accordinly.
- `start.sh` is similar to the Procfile on Heroku, it tells the server what actions to perform.

This project is live [here](https://flask-boiler-plate.glitch.me)
