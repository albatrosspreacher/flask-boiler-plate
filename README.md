# flask-boiler-plateâœ¨

### Flask boilerplate for a minimal "Hello World" application hosted on [Glitch](www.glitch.com)

- `server.py` contains the server side code.
- `index.html` contains the client side HTML code.
- `requirements.txt` contains a list of Python packages you import and use (in
  this case, it is only Flask).
- `glitch.json` contains the configuration file necessary for Glitch. Change the
  file names accordinly.
- `start.sh` is similar to the Procfile on Heroku, it tells the server what
  actions to perform.
